The problem with shortcuts:
  
Mostly lies in dragquerfile. 

Case single file that is a shortcut:
  dragqueryfile returns the path pointed to by shortcut.
  no owner drawing occurs - handlemenumsg is not called

Case multiple files and file with the focus is a shortcut:
  dragqueryfile returns the path pointed to by the shortcut and that's ALL.
  (only one file)
  no owner drawing occurs - handlemenumsg is not called

Case multiple files and file with the focus is not a shortcut:
  dragqueryfile returns all the files and and shortcuts are represented as lnk files
  instead of the path pointed to by the shortcut.

In the cases of no owner drawing - the menus are left blank. (not good)

My solution to this was to also register as a shortcut menu handler.
It seems to work fine, but there is a failsafe in the code that 
will disable owner drawing should the need arise.
